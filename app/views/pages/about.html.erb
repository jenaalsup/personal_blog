  <p>
    Hello, my name is Jena Alsup and I am a rising high school junior in the bay 
    area. Ever since I was little, I have always cared about preserving our 
    environment but was unsatisfied over the small impact I could make on the 
    world as an individual. I recycled when I could, walked instead of drove, and 
    did countless other small tasks, but it did not feel like enough. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In July of 2018, I made the decision to adopt a plant based diet with 
    sustainability and health in mind. Since then, I have worked to reduce my 
    carbon footprint as much as possible. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In my free time I like to read novels, experiment with new recipes, go on 
    long hikes, and learn new programming languages. I have started this blog 
    to document my journey and share my passion for sustainability and veganism 
    with others. I hope you enjoy my writing.
